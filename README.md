# web-console
A console for the web

An experiment to create a module web-based console.  Comes with two commands "echo {string}" and "import {url}".  Import will dump the script url on the page which is how you add more.

You may wish to import the included "dbx" script which allows you to navigate a dropbox folder using typical linux commands (uner construction).
