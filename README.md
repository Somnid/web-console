# web-console
A console for the web

An experiment to create a moduler web-based console.  Comes with two commands "echo {string}" and "import {url}".  Import will dump the script url on the page which is how you add more.  Echo just repeats the string.

You may wish to import the included "dbx" script which allows you to navigate a dropbox folder using typical linux commands (uner construction).
